## Overview

<!-- This section is for presenting the key takeaways and wire-ready content -->

**Data**

- Data source notes here

- Identify date range, scope, source

**Key findings**

- Average mileage is now `r avg_mpg` mpg

- Ten percent of X is now Y

- It looks like Z is unevenly distributed

- Ames, IA is a strong outlier

**Wire-ready copy**

- *Isolation increased by an average of 24% annually from 2006 to 2016.*

- *The typical first-time home buyer now has a household annual income of at least $123,000*

**Visuals**

```{r visuals}
# Put especially compelling data viz here
# ex.
car_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = disp, 
             y = mpg, 
             color = as.factor(cyl))) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_ap() +
  labs(title = "Gas guzzlers",
       subtitle = "Larger engines are less efficient",
       x = "Engine displacement (cubic inches)",
       y = "Efficiency (miles per gallon)"
  )
```

## Analysis

<!-- This section is for more detailed exposition of specific points -->

### 1: Is overfishing raising the calcium level?

No, because of reasons. Here's a graph:

```{r q1}
# Analysis/presentation code here
ggplot(anscombe, aes(x = x1, 
                     y = y1)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = 8.5, color = '#C83728') +
  theme_ap() +
  labs(title = "Fish and calcium",
       subtitle = "More fish means more calcium",
       x = "Fish (1,000 lbs)",
       y = "Calcium (kg)"
  )
```

### 2: How hard is it to get a home?
```{r q2}
# Analysis/presentation code here
iris %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Species, 
             y = Sepal.Length, 
             group = Species, 
             color = Species)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .25) +
  geom_jitter(width = .05) + 
  theme_ap() +
  labs(title = "Other stuff",
       subtitle = "These things are different",
       x = "Category (type)",
       y = "Length (inches)"
  )
```

## Questions

<!-- This section is for tracking open-ended questions for follow-up -->

### 1: How do we handle ABC?

### 2: Are we okay with XYZ?
